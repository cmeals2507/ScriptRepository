# Script Repository

## Overview

This is where any useful scripts created in Python, R, or other languages may be found. Very often, the code is cobbled together from other sources (e.g., StackOverflow), and I do my best to attribute where and when possible. 

For instance, many of the scripts in the "ICD" folder are courtesy of [Khoa Lam](https://github.com/LKchemposer), as is the notebook linked below.
